Take the sentence, "You used the wrong 'to.'" Now say it out loud. To a person who is hearing that sentence for the first time, which form of 'to' would they interpret if they were told to write it down? Taken out of context, the sentence could be formed using any of the forms of 'to/too/two' and still be grammatically correct (though since the context is unknown, could be semantically incorrect). So no matter what the person writes, they are not necessarily wrong.

So does this mean that there is some ambiguous form of every homonym that needs to exist to represent all of the forms of the sound, but have no real meaning? Its only purpose being used as an identifier for any and all forms of that sound?

Maybe in this case: 'twoo'?

Food for though.
