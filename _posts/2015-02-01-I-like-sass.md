I have less than a year under my belt for web development. During which I have experienced quite a bit of CSS. CSS is a powerful tool. Lots of us use it every day. I love what it can do, it is like a set of paintbrushes for a web designer. A set of paintbrushes each with its own, sometimes seemingly repetitive, functions.

[Sass][Sass], CSS with superpowers. I tend to agree with their assessment of their language.
I was introduced to Sass by some coworkers. We use it quite a bit at work. It has become a standard there and I adopted it as a standard on my own projects. I would recommend it to anyone looking to extend their CSS.

CSS being somewhat of a declarative language and Sass being an extension language, it doesn't necessarily add functionality to the CSS. It really just makes CSS more intuitive and readable to a human. The gains are things like variables, nesting, and partials. Being able to compile your styles into separate sections, especially with the nesting, is fantastic. I urge anyone interested in all of the features of Sass to go check out the [Learn Sass][Learn Sass] section of their site.

The transition is easy. I actually use the SCSS (stands for Sassy CSS) version of Sass. In which all valid regular CSS is valid Sass code. The Sass version has its own syntax; for instance not using semi-colons.

There is much more to say and many more features of Sass. Some of which I have used many times and some of which I still have yet to use. I look forward to utilizing Sass to its full functionality in the near future. Until then I will continue to learn and actually enjoy doing so with such a great tool.
