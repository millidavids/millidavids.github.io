My (first) college degree could be seen as a waste of time. For a while I even thought so. I graduated with a bachelors of arts in psychology from the University of Kentucky in 2012. Do not ask me why it took so long (high school graduate of 2006). I had my ups and downs and a medical withdrawal, but that is besides the point. The point is; it appears that I have wasted 6 years of my life on a degree that I did not decide to pursue.

I had a good time in college. For almost all of my college years, I lived in a house with 9 of my closest friends. Most of us were studious and we got along great; good friends and good roommates. Psychology was easy. I had heard throughout my younger years in middle and high school that college was to be, not necessarily feared, but respected, in its difficulty. I however seems to breeze through my psychology degree. That should have been my first red flag.

A few more red flags and a couple of years later, I graduated. I had been looking into pursuing industrial/organizational psychology in graduate school. The University of Kentucky, however, had almost zero I/O psychology presence. I was left to my own devices when researching I/O psychology and in doing so, built up a false sense of what the degree actually was. I was accepted into Northern Kentucky University in their I/O psychology program and started fall of 2012, immediately following my undergraduate graduation. I dropped out of graduate school the very next semester.

I/O psychology had not been for me. I will not get into all of the details on why. I can say that it is not what I thought it had been, and it is definitely not something that I would have been happy doing for the rest of my life.

That following semester, the semester I had dropped out, I had a major surgery. I was living with my dad at the time and found out, through some serious abdominal pains that my insides were all jumbled up. That is a post for another day. However, during recovery and beyond I began looking into teaching myself how to write basic programs, starting with a little Ruby and [Python][Python]. I loved it.

This was it. This was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Algorithmic thinking came naturally to me. From implementing mathematical problems into a program to being able to create a virtual thing from bits, I ate it up. Soon after the young adolescent love stage with programming languages came the feeling of regret. I started to regret the last 6 years of my life; Six years I had seemingly thrown down the drain; six years of scholarships I had wasted on a degree that I now do absolutely nothing with.

Another large decision I had to make was whether to go back to school for Computer Science. It was going to cost money this time. It was going to put me into debt, but I did not care. Many people go into debt with student loans and come out just fine. I loved the subject matter and wanted desperately to pursue a career in all things computers. Fall 2013 I started back at the University of Kentucky for computer science and loved every minute of it. I did well. I was faced with challenges, but welcomed them. I seemed to advance my knowledge at an alarming rate, especially when pitted against the progress that my fellow classmates were making. I had found my niche.

Fast forward to summer of 2014. I had been in school 2 semesters and had desperately been trying to find internships (for about 6 months) so I could stop working as a server in a restaurant. Two opportunities presented themselves to me and I took both, juggling both internships over the beginning of the summer. One was a student technician in a bioinformatics laboratory on campus at UK and the other was a simple internship at a web development firm, [CirrusMIo][CirrusMio]. A month laster I was pulled on full time at CirrusMio, dropped the other internship, put school on hold, and this is where I am now. I love my job and I love the people I work with.

Why then do I not regret psychology anymore? Throughout my brief stint in school for computer science (which I completely intend to finish) and starting my job in web development, I came to realize that I am actually using psychology. Or rather that I started utilizing the things I learned in psychology to help my web development. I'm not applying the scientific method to everything and writing long statistical analyses of anything. I am simply taking notice of the possible subtle applications of psychological concepts to everyday activities at my job.

I may not have decided to pursue psychology, but a stagnant degree doesn't necessarily need to be stagnant. I decided to utilize it. Did it pay off? Maybe not in the way I had originally planned. But then who can predict the future? I certainly cannot. I just tried to make the best out of what I had done and what I had accomplished.
