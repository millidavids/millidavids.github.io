Last year, on Christmas day, I decided that my new years resolution for 2015 would be something involving developing my developing skills. So I decided to try to keep a 365 github streak going for 2015.

So far I am accomplishing this by contributing to my own public repositories. And I am doing so without days of simply commenting a line in a project (although I did once when I was sick). I decided to make this site, am working on a couple of other applications, and am contributing to a public project that my coworkers and I are working on. That project, a [Golang][Golang] application that will alert you if you are about to break your github streak.

This site seems to be going well; as well as can be expected I guess. I am quite happy with the layout and the pure CSS parallax that I got working. Currently the home page could use some work. And I need to update the about page, but progress is steady.

The Golang application is slowing down. There is a kind of 'connotation' that comes with developing an application with coworkers in the off hours, when we had just come away from working on projects all day. The nice thing in this instance, is that we are all learning Go together. I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish with this application and this language. Go being a young language is sometimes frustrating to work with. Especially after coming away working with [Ruby][Ruby] all day.

Eventually, as my skills and knowledge grow, I plan to branch out and start contributing to other open source projects; my way of giving back. I admire those that write the numerous tool that I use daily, hoping one day that I will be one of those people.
