This marks the beginning of my blog posts. What will I be posting about? Who knows. Probably nothing in particular, but all revolving around the world of web development. Seeing as how I started my career in web development last June, loving every minute of it; I will probably report on any and all things I find useful and/or fun regarding web development. Think of this as a journal... a journal that I plan on updating quite often... a live journal... damn.

This first post was created during the development of my site. Among many other projects, I decided to get this site up and running as soon as I could. The first couple of posts will probably be about this site. Subsequent one will include my other projects, which you can view on my [github profile][github].

Keeping this first post short, I will probably just thank all of the developers that made all of the (cool)tools I am using right now to make my site. Take [Jekyll][jekyll] for instance. This whole site was created using [Jekyll][jekyll]. Another cool guide I used for the parallax effect of my background came from [this post on coderwall][coderwallpost]. Thank you guys and gals, for all of your time and smarts.
