Like many other people, especially in the fields of engineering and development, I spend much of my time continually learning new things. I try to keep myself updated on the work of technology so as not to be left behind in the times. I am always wanted to learn all of the tips and tricks of my trade. Though one thing that may slip the minds of lots of people are the benefits of learning how to keep yourself physically fit and healthy can have.

I was once like this. I was so focused on keeping my mind healthy and strong (also... video games) that I completely neglected by body. I gained lots of weight. I was prone to sickness. I felt, generally, awful all of the time. It was my the end of my freshman year of college that I decided to shape up and start exercising.

Now I am not saying to just go and throw weights around and run until your exhausted. Be smart about it. Like all good engineers, do your research first. I started simple. I researched running habits, limits, conditioning exercises and started with those. My first concern was weight loss. I then moved onto weight lifting and have been loving it ever since. Throughout college, I lost around 35 pounds, and gained a considerable amount of muscle mass. I was nigh infinitely more athletic, felt better, and oh so much stronger.

It was then that I started to look into dieting. I settled on a ketogenic diet (weight loss was again a focus, I wanted to look even better). This diet got me to lose another 35 pounds during my short stint in graduate school when finding time to exercise between my hour and half commute, full time job, and school, was hard. But not only was the diet good for weight loss. It made me more conscious of what I was eating, when I was eating, and how much I was eating. I started reading food labels, counting carbohydrates, and counting calories. You know how some people tell you that you will never use calculus outside of school? Well let me tell you this... I still haven't found a way to apply calculus to carbohydrate and caloric calculations, but maybe someday.

I highly recommend finding a workout program and a dieting regime. They improve so much about life and are so widely neglected. I just want to spread the work. Your physical body and emotional mind and intellectual mind are all closely related; causing one suffering one will only bring down the others.
